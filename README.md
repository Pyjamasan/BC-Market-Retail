# BC-Market-Retail

Welcome to this business case. It's time to take a step back from the technical, and focus on the value of analysis: the advice.

In this quest, a client has a business problem. You'll need to provide data-driven advice to help them make the best decision. This is what we call D3M: Data-Driven Decision Making.

This is a challenge quest. No new concept here, and total freedom for your analysis. It's the opportunity to use all your knowledge on a new dataset.
In your future jobs, you will not be "guided" by a quest. It's the same here, you have a business topic, it's up to you to try to solve it as well as possible. We trust you: you are going to make a very good analysis.
Try to make this analysis understandable to everyone. Not everyone is a data analyst, so you have to be able to popularize it with charts and comments.
